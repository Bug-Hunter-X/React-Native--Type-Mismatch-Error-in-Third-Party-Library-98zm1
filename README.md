This repository demonstrates a common React Native bug involving type mismatches when using third-party libraries.  The `bug.js` file shows the incorrect code that leads to the error, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version.  The error arises from passing an incorrectly typed prop to a component that expects a specific data type, causing unexpected behavior or crashes. This example highlights the importance of careful type checking and ensuring data consistency when working with external libraries in React Native applications.
