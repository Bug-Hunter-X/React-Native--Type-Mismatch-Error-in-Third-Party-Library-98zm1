This error occurs when using a third-party library that expects a specific type of data, but your component is passing a different type. This often happens with data fetched from an API or passed down from a parent component.  For example, if a library expects a number but gets a string, or if it expects an array but gets an object, this can cause unexpected behavior.

```javascript
//Incorrect Type
<SomeComponent data="123" />

//Correct Type
<SomeComponent data={123} />
```
